1. Write an application that plays “guess the number” as follows: Your program chooses the number to be guessed by selecting a random integer in the range 1 to 1000. The application displays the prompt Guess a number between 1 and 1000. The player inputs a first guess. If the player's guess is incorrect, your program should display Too high. Try again. or Too low. Try again. to help the player “zero in” on the correct answer. The program should prompt the user for the next guess. When the user enters the correct answer, display Congratulations. You guessed the number!, and allow the user to choose whether to play again. [Note: The guessing technique employed in this problem is similar to a binary search, which is discussed in Chapter 19, Searching, Sorting and Big O.]

3. Create class Rectangle. The class has attributes length and width, each of
which defaults to 1. It has read-only properties that calculate the Perimeter
and the Area of the rectangle. It has properties for both length and width.
The set accessors should verify that length and width are each floating-point
numbers greater than 0.0 and less than 20.0. Write an application to test class
Rectangle.
